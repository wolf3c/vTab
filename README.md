# Why develop this new vertical tab manager?

There are three reasons why I develop this Chrome extension: 

1. firstly, I opened to many tabs and windows in Chrome. It's hard to switch into the new tabs because there is no space show the tab at top. And it's hard to check the tabs I opened several months.
2. then, there are so many tabs manager extensions I found, but they used Chrome side panel technique. The operation of toggling the side panel is not smooth. And the minimal width of side panel takes a lot of space.
3. finally, AI empowered my technique. I asked GPT build the first version of vTab in 1hour 52mins.
